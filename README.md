# 🛡️ VigilEd: Always Watching, Always Caring

A role-based educational web platform where teachers, parents, and admins work together to monitor and respond to student risks. Teachers submit data, parents stay informed and respond, while admins handle high-risk cases with BFS-based home visit planning and priority queue logic for alerting.
